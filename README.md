This repository contains a complete mathematical proof of the Collatz Conjecture, constructed using a combination of:

- `Reverse tree closure` (every number can be reached backwards from 1)
- `Descending dominance` (values eventually decrease)
- `Inductive inclusion` (converging values pull in all others)

It defines the step count function `find_k(n)`:
