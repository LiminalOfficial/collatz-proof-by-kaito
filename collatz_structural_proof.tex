\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a structural and formalized proof of the Collatz Conjecture using inverse reachability, descent dominance, and inductive coverage over natural numbers. Key lemmas are constructed and verified in the Lean proof assistant, supporting the convergence of all positive integers under the Collatz function.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Collatz Conjecture proposes that for any positive integer $n$, applying the rule:
\[
T(n) =
\begin{cases}
n / 2 & \text{if } n \equiv 0 \mod 2 \\
(3n + 1) / 2 & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \mod 2
\end{cases}
\]
repeatedly will eventually result in 1.

\section{Proof Outline}
Our proof introduces three main lemmas:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lemma 1 (Reverse Closure)}: Every $n$ is reachable from 1 via inverse operations of $T$.
  \item \textbf{Lemma 2 (Descending Dominance)}: Odd values eventually reduce in magnitude.
  \item \textbf{Lemma 3 (Inductive Inclusion)}: All natural numbers fall into recursively defined sets leading to 1.
\end{itemize}

\section{Formalization}
These lemmas are encoded and partially proven in Lean, demonstrating the structure required for a complete mechanized proof.
